AGGIE WORKS TAKE HOME:<br>
To Install: Runs on Node. Clone this repo in order to install<br>
To Run Client: To run client, open the "client" directory on powershell and run "npm start"<br>

Once running: Click on the make tab to create your own quizzes, once they are submitted, you will get an ID back. To take your quiz, click on the "Take Quiz" tab and type your ID and Username. I created a 5-6 question Demoquiz which has an ID of 1036.<br>
Notes: This site runs on react version 5 since I found it more reliable. Additionally, this project was started 10/2 and still has some complications. The project does not have a time based feature and cannot check for unique usernames as of now.
